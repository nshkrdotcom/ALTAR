# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LATER (Local Agent & Tool Execution Runtime) v1.0 specification establishes a foundational, language-agnostic protocol for enabling in-process tool execution by AI agents. It defines the abstract components and data structures necessary for a host application to discover, reason about, and execute local functions as tools.

LATER serves as a local-first companion to the distributed ALTAR protocol, providing a seamless "promotion path" for tools to evolve from local development to distributed production environments. The protocol emphasizes automated introspection and minimal boilerplate to create a "just works" experience for developers across any programming language that implements the specification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Protocol Foundation

**User Story:** As a protocol architect, I want LATER to be defined as a language-agnostic protocol specification, so that it can be implemented across multiple programming languages while maintaining interoperability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the specification is authored THEN it SHALL clearly distinguish between abstract protocol requirements and specific implementation patterns
2. WHEN defining protocol components THEN the specification SHALL use language-neutral terminology and concepts
3. WHEN providing implementation examples THEN the specification SHALL explicitly label them as reference implementations for a specific language
4. IF implementation-specific patterns are shown THEN they SHALL be accompanied by guidance for achieving equivalent functionality in other languages

### Requirement 2: Tool Declaration Mechanism

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to declare local functions as tools using an idiomatic mechanism for my programming language, so that I can expose functionality to AI agents with minimal boilerplate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a compliant implementation provides a tool declaration mechanism THEN it SHALL use language-appropriate patterns (e.g., macros in Elixir, decorators in Python, annotations in Java)
2. WHEN a developer uses the tool declaration mechanism THEN the system SHALL automatically introspect the function signature to generate tool schemas
3. WHEN a function is declared as a tool THEN the system SHALL extract parameter names, types, and documentation to create a complete tool definition
4. WHEN schema generation occurs THEN the system SHALL map language-native types to standardized schema types compatible with ALTAR (e.g., an Elixir integer maps to the :INTEGER schema type, a Python str maps to the :STRING schema type)
5. IF a function has default parameter values THEN the schema SHALL mark those parameters as optional
6. WHEN a tool is declared THEN it SHALL be registered in the Global Tool Definition Registry for later session-scoped availability

### Requirement 3: Two-Tier Registry Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a registry system that separates global tool definitions from session-scoped availability, so that tools are properly isolated while maintaining efficient discovery and invocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL maintain a Global Tool Definition Registry containing all declared tools and their schemas
2. WHEN a session is created THEN it SHALL have access to a Session-Scoped Tool Registry that references available tools for that session
3. WHEN tools are made available to a session THEN the session registry SHALL store references to global tool definitions along with session-specific metadata
4. WHEN tools are queried for a session THEN the registry SHALL return tool definitions in a format compatible with ALTAR FunctionDeclaration structures
5. WHEN a session ends THEN the session registry SHALL clean up all associated tool references
6. IF multiple tools with the same name exist in the global registry THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts by using the last registered tool and logging a warning

### Requirement 4: Local Tool Executor

**User Story:** As a runtime system, I want an executor that can reliably invoke local functions based on standardized function calls, so that AI agents can execute tools consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the executor receives a FunctionCall THEN it SHALL validate the call against the registered tool schema
2. WHEN parameters are validated THEN the executor SHALL ensure type compatibility and required parameter presence
3. WHEN a tool is invoked THEN the executor SHALL call the corresponding local function with properly formatted parameters
4. WHEN execution completes successfully THEN the executor SHALL return a structured FunctionResponse with the result
5. IF execution fails THEN the executor SHALL return a structured error response with diagnostic information
6. WHEN handling concurrent calls THEN the executor SHALL ensure safe concurrent execution according to the host language's concurrency model

### Requirement 5: ALTAR Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer building AI applications, I want LATER tools to use the same data structures as ALTAR, so that I can promote local tools to distributed environments without changing contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tool schemas are generated THEN they SHALL use FunctionDeclaration structures compatible with gemini_ex and ALTAR
2. WHEN function calls are processed THEN they SHALL use the standard FunctionCall data structure from gemini_ex
3. WHEN results are returned THEN they SHALL use the standard FunctionResponse structure from gemini_ex
4. WHEN schema types are defined THEN they SHALL map to the same Schema types used by ALTAR
5. IF a tool needs to be promoted to ALTAR THEN the schema SHALL remain unchanged, requiring only execution mechanism updates

### Requirement 6: Automated Schema Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tool schemas to be automatically generated from function signatures and documentation, so that I don't need to manually maintain schema definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function is introspected THEN the system SHALL extract parameter names from the function signature
2. WHEN primitive type information is available THEN the system SHALL map native types to appropriate schema types (string, integer, float, boolean)
3. WHEN complex type information is available THEN the system SHALL generate schemas for arrays and objects, including nested structures
4. WHEN array types are detected THEN the system SHALL determine the element type and generate appropriate array schemas
5. WHEN object/struct types are detected THEN the system SHALL introspect properties and required fields to generate object schemas
6. WHEN function documentation exists THEN the system SHALL use it as the tool description
7. WHEN parameter documentation exists THEN the system SHALL use it for parameter descriptions
8. IF type information is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with guidance for resolution

### Requirement 7: Host Application Integration

**User Story:** As an application developer using an LLM client library, I want LATER to integrate seamlessly with my existing application, so that local tools work transparently alongside remote capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the host application requests available tools THEN LATER SHALL provide them in the expected FunctionDeclaration format
2. WHEN the LLM returns a function call THEN the host application SHALL be able to dispatch it to LATER for execution
3. WHEN LATER completes execution THEN it SHALL return results in a format the host application can send back to the LLM
4. WHEN tool execution results are returned THEN they SHALL be JSON-serializable data structures (primitives, maps, lists)
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be propagated to the host application in a structured format
6. IF the host application manages multiple sessions THEN LATER SHALL maintain proper session isolation

### Requirement 8: Language-Idiomatic Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LATER implementation to feel natural and idiomatic in my programming language, so that it integrates smoothly with my existing development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using LATER THEN the API SHALL follow the host language's established conventions and patterns
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be reported using the host language's standard error handling mechanisms
3. WHEN debugging tools THEN developers SHALL have access to clear error messages and diagnostic information
4. WHEN writing tests THEN the LATER components SHALL be easily mockable and testable using the host language's testing frameworks
5. IF configuration is needed THEN it SHALL use the host language's standard configuration mechanisms

### Requirement 9: Type Safety and Validation

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want robust parameter validation and type checking, so that tool execution is reliable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN function calls are received THEN all parameters SHALL be validated against the tool schema
2. WHEN type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL reject the call with a descriptive error message
3. WHEN required parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN parameter values are out of acceptable ranges THEN the system SHALL enforce constraints defined in the schema
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL not attempt to execute the underlying function

### Requirement 10: Session Management

**User Story:** As an application architect, I want proper session lifecycle management, so that resources are properly allocated and cleaned up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is created THEN LATER SHALL initialize a new session-scoped registry and executor context
2. WHEN a session is created THEN it SHALL be able to specify which globally-defined tools should be made available
3. WHEN a session is active THEN tools SHALL only be accessible within that session context
4. WHEN a session ends THEN all associated session-scoped resources SHALL be properly cleaned up
5. IF multiple sessions exist concurrently THEN they SHALL be completely isolated from each other
6. WHEN tools are made available to a session THEN they SHALL reference the global tool definitions without duplicating schema information
