# **Analysis of Similar Specifications, Protocols, and Implementations to the ALTAR Protocol**

## **1\. Introduction**

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents, necessitates robust protocols for their interaction with external tools, data sources, and other AI entities. This report investigates existing specifications, protocols, and implementations that exhibit similarities to the hypothetical ALTAR Protocol, providing a comprehensive overview of the current landscape. The analysis focuses on key areas including LLM function calling, AI agent communication and interoperability, tool management and orchestration frameworks, distributed computing and runtime models, and overarching architectural considerations such as scalability, observability, security, and state management. By examining these established and emerging standards, this report aims to identify foundational patterns and critical design elements that could inform or parallel the structure and capabilities of the ALTAR Protocol.

## **2\. Large Language Model (LLM) Function Calling Protocols**

LLM function calling protocols enable generative AI models to interact with external systems by generating structured data that specifies function names and arguments, rather than directly invoking functions. This capability transforms LLMs from mere text generators into intelligent orchestrators capable of performing actions in the real world.1

### **2.1. OpenAI Function Calling Protocol**

OpenAI's function calling capability allows GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models to receive user-defined functions as input and produce structured output.2 This mechanism enhances the consistency of model responses, reducing reliance on regular expressions or complex prompt engineering for information extraction.2 Developers define custom functions by specifying a name, a description of their functionality, and parameters, including their type and description, within a JSON schema.2 This structured definition helps the OpenAI API identify the correct function and its arguments. The system supports multiple custom functions within a single chat completion request.2

A notable aspect of OpenAI's implementation is its ability to handle complex nested JSON outputs by defining hierarchical relationships within the parameters property of the function schema.2 Furthermore, it facilitates integration with external APIs or databases by allowing custom functions to execute API calls or database queries based on model-passed arguments.2 If a model's function call does not match a defined function or schema, the system defaults to a standard text-based response, ensuring flexibility.2 The Assistants API, similar to the Chat Completions API, also supports function calling, allowing developers to define functions under the

tools parameter of an assistant.3

### **2.2. Google Gemini Function Calling Protocol**

Google's Gemini models also feature function calling, which significantly improves the LLM's ability to provide relevant and contextual answers.1 The Function Calling API enables developers to provide custom functions to the generative AI model. The model, similar to OpenAI, does not execute these functions directly but generates structured data output, including the function name and suggested arguments.1 This output is then used by the application to invoke external APIs or information systems like databases or CRM systems.1

Gemini supports a wide range of models, including various versions of Gemini 2.5 and 2.0.1 A single request can include up to 128 function declarations.1 Function declarations are defined based on OpenAPI 3.0 specifications, detailing the function's name, an optional description, and parameters, which are described using the OpenAPI JSON Schema Object format.1 The parameters can specify data types such as STRING, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, NUMBER, ARRAY, and OBJECT, along with descriptions, enums, and required properties.1

Gemini offers flexible function calling configurations: AUTO (default, model decides between function call and natural language), NONE (no function calls), and ANY (model is constrained to always predict a function call, optionally from a predefined list).1 The model's predicted function call includes the function name and a structured JSON object for arguments.1 After execution, the function's response, also in JSON object format, is returned to the model as context for generating a user-friendly response.1 The process typically involves defining the function declaration, calling the model with declarations, executing the function code (which is the application's responsibility), and then sending the result back to the model for a final user-friendly response.4

### **2.3. Anthropic Claude Tool Use Protocol**

Anthropic's Claude models adopt a distinct approach to tool integration, differing from OpenAI's explicit function calling mechanisms.5 Claude treats everything as content items within a message, including tool calls.5 This content-based architecture means there is no separate wrapper object or type specification for a tool; a tool is simply a type of content.5

When Claude decides to use a tool, its response includes a "tool use" content item, which contains the tool's name, a unique ID, and its arguments.5 The application then triggers the execution of this tool. A critical difference is how tool results are handled: Anthropic treats tool results as user messages with special content.5 This design maintains a natural conversational flow, where the interaction appears as if the user is providing the tool's output to the assistant.5 This approach can enable fine-grained control over conversation flow and is suitable when deep integration with Claude's content model is desired.5 Claude also supports parallel execution of multiple tools when requested.5 Beyond general tools, Claude can interact with computer environments through a "computer use" tool, providing capabilities like screenshot capture, mouse control, keyboard input, and desktop automation.6

### **2.4. Comparative Analysis of LLM Function Calling**

The various LLM function calling protocols, while serving the common purpose of enabling LLMs to interact with external systems, exhibit distinct design philosophies and implementation details. OpenAI and Google Gemini both rely on explicit function schemas, often based on OpenAPI specifications, where the LLM's role is to generate structured calls that an external application then executes.1 This approach maintains a clear separation of concerns: the LLM decides

*what* action to take and *with what parameters*, but the application is responsible for *how* that action is performed and for feeding the results back to the LLM.4 This model inherently supports the integration of LLMs with diverse external APIs and databases, providing a robust framework for extending LLM capabilities beyond their training data.1

Anthropic's Claude, on the other hand, adopts a content-based architecture where tool calls and their results are embedded directly within the conversational flow as content items.5 This design choice promotes conversational naturalness and simplicity by treating tools as an intrinsic part of the dialogue rather than a separate API interaction layer.5 This difference in approach highlights a fundamental trade-off: explicit schema-based function calling offers clear structural contracts and potentially easier programmatic integration, while content-based tool use prioritizes a more fluid and human-like interaction paradigm.

The common thread across all these implementations is the recognition that LLMs need to leverage external capabilities to be truly useful in complex applications. The mechanisms for defining tools (schemas, descriptions), invoking them (structured output from LLM), and feeding back results (context for LLM) are central to all these protocols. For a protocol like ALTAR, understanding these established patterns is crucial. It suggests that ALTAR would need to define its own structured method for LLMs to express intent to use external capabilities. This could involve a schema definition language for tools, a clear mechanism for the LLM to output tool invocation requests, and a standardized way for the application to return tool execution results. The choice between a more explicit, API-like interaction (OpenAI, Gemini) and a more conversational, content-driven approach (Claude) would depend on ALTAR's primary use cases and design goals for agent-LLM interaction.

## **3\. AI Agent Communication and Interoperability Standards**

As AI systems evolve into multi-agent architectures, the need for standardized communication and interoperability becomes paramount. Several initiatives are addressing this fragmentation, aiming to enable seamless collaboration between diverse AI agents.

### **3.1. Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic and launched in late 2024, is an open-standard system designed to connect LLMs with external tools and data sources effectively.7 It functions as a "universal translator" or a "USB-C port for AI applications," standardizing how applications provide context to LLMs.7 MCP aims to solve the "NÃ—M" data integration problem by eliminating the need for custom connectors for each data source or tool.10

Key features of MCP include standardized integration, context management, and robust security and isolation.7 It ensures the AI model maintains conversation context across multiple steps, preventing loss of information during complex tasks.7 MCP uses a client-server architecture, drawing inspiration from the Language Server Protocol (LSP), to standardize how AI applications interact with external systems.10 Servers expose capabilities like resources (contextual data identified by URIs), prompts (templated messages), and tools (functions for AI models to execute).12

Communication in MCP is primarily via JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.12 It supports two main transport methods: STDIO for local integrations and HTTP+SSE (Server-Sent Events) for remote connections and streaming.10 MCP emphasizes security and trust, requiring explicit user consent for data access, operations, tool invocation, and LLM sampling.12 It also mandates that hosts obtain user consent before exposing user data to servers and protect data with appropriate access controls.12 Tool descriptions are considered untrusted unless from a trusted server, and users should understand tool actions before authorization.12 MCP supports OAuth flows for authorization.14

The protocol has seen significant adoption, including by OpenAI and Google DeepMind, highlighting its potential as a universal open standard for AI system connectivity.11 Implementations are available in various languages, including Python and TypeScript, with numerous reference servers for integrations like PostgreSQL, Slack, GitHub, and web browsing tools.14

### **3.2. Agent Connect Protocol (ACP) and AGNTCY Initiative**

The Agent Connect Protocol (ACP) is an open standard, part of the AGNTCY initiative, designed to solve the growing challenge of connecting AI agents, applications, and humans across different frameworks and infrastructures.8 It aims to create an "Internet of Agents" where intelligent systems can seamlessly link up, exchange information, and act together in complex workflows.22

ACP is built on a REST-first, HTTP-native architecture, leveraging simple, well-defined REST endpoints that align with standard HTTP patterns.20 This contrasts with MCP's reliance on JSON-RPC.21 ACP supports all forms of modality and message types using MimeTypes, making it highly extensible for various data formats.20 It is primarily asynchronous by design, suitable for long-running tasks, but also supports synchronous communication and streaming interactions (typically via Server-Sent Events over HTTP).20

Agent discovery is a key feature, with support for both online and offline discovery through embedded metadata in distribution packages.20 ACP is SDK-optional, allowing direct use with standard HTTP tools, though official Python and TypeScript SDKs are available.20 The protocol is agnostic to internal agent implementations, focusing on minimal specifications for compatibility.20

The AGNTCY initiative, which includes ACP, also encompasses the Open Agent Schema Framework (OASF) for defining agent capabilities and an Agent Directory for discovering compatible agents.8 While ACP enables agent orchestration by standardizing communication, it does not manage workflows or deployments itself.25 It is developed under the Linux Foundation, ensuring open governance.21

### **3.3. Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF)**

The Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF), launched in early 2025 as part of the AGNTCY initiative, provides standardized schemas for defining AI agent capabilities, interactions, and metadata.8 It offers structured ways to describe agent attributes and relationships using attribute-based taxonomies.8 OASF aims to address interoperability challenges by defining common data structures, ensuring unique agent identification for discovery, and providing extension capabilities for third-party features.27

OASF significantly enhances interoperability by enforcing schema validation, which ensures agents adhere to predefined interaction patterns and prevents data format mismatches during communication.8 This allows agents built on different frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen) to collaborate seamlessly.8 The framework supports an Agent Directory that stores OASF-compliant metadata, enabling agents to discover peers based on capabilities and attributes, thereby solving the "agent discovery" problem in distributed systems.8

Security is a core aspect of OASF. It enhances trust in multi-agent interactions by defining identity verification requirements and establishing data integrity checks.8 This creates a foundation for secure inter-agent communication without relying on proprietary security implementations.8 The framework also supports complex multi-agent workflows through agent manifest standardization and integration with Workflow Servers for executing OASF-defined workflows across diverse agents.8 OASF's attribute-based taxonomy system organizes agent capabilities hierarchically and supports dynamic schema extensions, accommodating new agent types and use cases without breaking existing integrations.8

### **3.4. Comparative Analysis of AI Agent Interoperability**

The landscape of AI agent interoperability is characterized by distinct yet complementary approaches, primarily exemplified by MCP, ACP, and OASF. MCP focuses on providing a standardized way for LLMs to access external tools and data, acting as a "universal remote" for AI applications.10 Its core strength lies in context management and tool exposure, using JSON-RPC over STDIO or HTTP+SSE.10 This makes MCP highly suitable for enabling a single LLM or agent to interact with a wide array of backend services.

In contrast, ACP and OASF, both part of the broader AGNTCY initiative, address the more complex challenge of agent-to-agent communication and collaboration.8 ACP is designed as an HTTP-native, REST-based protocol for direct communication between agents, supporting various modalities and asynchronous/synchronous interactions.20 This design choice prioritizes simplicity of integration with existing web infrastructure and aims to foster a truly interconnected "Internet of Agents".21 OASF complements ACP by providing the necessary structured metadata for agents to describe their capabilities and discover one another, ensuring semantic compatibility across diverse platforms.8 The emphasis on schema validation and identity verification within OASF is critical for building trust and enabling secure collaboration in multi-agent ecosystems.8

A key difference lies in their primary interaction focus and communication styles. MCP is more about a host (e.g., an LLM application) interacting with a server exposing tools and resources.12 ACP, on the other hand, is explicitly designed for peer-to-peer agent communication, facilitating complex workflows where specialized agents collaborate in real-time.24 The choice of JSON-RPC for MCP versus REST for ACP also reflects different design priorities: JSON-RPC can be more rigid but potentially more efficient for defined remote procedure calls, while REST offers greater flexibility and alignment with web standards for broader interoperability.21

For a protocol like ALTAR, these comparisons highlight that a comprehensive solution for AI systems requires addressing both the LLM-to-tool interface (akin to MCP's context provision) and the agent-to-agent communication (akin to ACP's interoperability). Furthermore, the need for standardized schemas for agent capabilities and discovery (OASF) is fundamental for any scalable multi-agent system. The emphasis on user consent, data privacy, and tool safety within MCP 12 and identity verification in OASF 8 underscores that security and ethical considerations are not afterthoughts but core design principles for modern AI protocols. ALTAR would greatly benefit from adopting a multi-layered approach to security, ensuring both technical robustness and user control over autonomous operations.

## **4\. Tool Management and Orchestration Frameworks**

Beyond the core protocols, various frameworks provide higher-level abstractions and functionalities for managing and orchestrating tools and agents, streamlining the development of LLM-driven applications.

### **4.1. LangChain**

LangChain is an open-source orchestration framework available in Python and JavaScript, designed for developing applications using LLMs.29 It provides a generic interface for nearly any LLM, offering a centralized environment to build applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows.29 LangChain's modular approach allows developers to compare different prompts and foundation models with minimal code changes.29

Key components of LangChain include document loaders for importing data from various sources (e.g., file storage, web content, databases), vector databases for efficient retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and text splitters for processing large documents.29 LangChain supports both traditional RAG, where LLMs reference a vector database, and agentic RAG systems, which can also encompass tools for tasks like mathematical calculations or data analysis.29

LangChain can integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by loading MCP-defined tools into its agent framework.7 This enables LangChain agents to utilize MCP servers for accessing external capabilities like math operations or weather APIs.7 LangChain agents can also maintain "memory for context persistence," which is crucial for multi-turn conversations and complex tasks.25

### **4.2. LlamaIndex**

LlamaIndex.TS is another framework that focuses on making it simple to make single LLM calls with tools while abstracting the complexity of executing those tools and generating tool messages.30 It provides low-level LLM execution capabilities, allowing for precise control over message handling and tool execution, which is valuable for building custom agent logic within workflow steps.30

The llm.exec method in LlamaIndex takes messages and tools as parameters. The LLM might either request to call one or more tools or generate an assistant message. For requested tool calls, llm.exec executes them and generates the tool call and result messages.30 A common pattern in LlamaIndex is to use

llm.exec in a loop until the LLM stops making tool calls, requiring the maintenance of message history to ensure proper context and implementing exit conditions to avoid infinite loops.30 LlamaIndex also supports streaming responses for real-time interactions.30

Beyond single LLM calls, LlamaIndex's workflow capabilities support parallel execution of steps. By setting a num\_workers parameter in a @step decorator, developers can control the number of steps executed simultaneously, enabling efficient parallel processing for scenarios like multiple sub-queries.31 This highlights a focus on optimizing performance for complex agentic workflows.

### **4.3. AutoGen**

AutoGen is a multi-agentic framework that defines an Agent as an abstract protocol with basic messaging methods.32 Agents in AutoGen communicate exclusively through messages, which can be strings or dictionaries.33 An agent has properties like

name and description and methods for sending (send) and receiving messages.32

When an agent receives a message, its on\_message() handler is invoked to implement the message handling logic.33 AutoGen supports routing messages of the same type to different handlers based on criteria like the sender agent, using a

match parameter.33 Communication types include direct messaging, where a sender expects a response from the receiver (similar to a function call between agents), and broadcast, which is one-way communication where no response is received.33 Direct messaging is suitable for tightly coupled sender-recipient scenarios, such as an agent executing tool calls via a

ToolAgent.33

AutoGen's architecture facilitates the creation of conversational agents that can interact with each other to solve tasks. The framework's emphasis on message-based communication and flexible message handling provides a robust foundation for building complex multi-agent systems.

### **4.4. Comparative Analysis of Tool Management and Orchestration**

LangChain, LlamaIndex, and AutoGen represent different facets of tool management and orchestration within AI systems. LangChain acts as a versatile orchestration framework, providing a unified interface for LLMs to interact with various data sources and tools, including those exposed via MCP.7 Its strength lies in abstracting away the complexities of integrating diverse components and enabling both traditional and agentic RAG. The ability for LangChain agents to maintain conversational memory is a critical feature for sustained, multi-turn interactions.25

LlamaIndex, while also supporting tool integration, offers more granular control over low-level LLM execution and explicitly supports parallel processing of workflow steps.30 This focus on fine-grained control and parallelism makes it particularly well-suited for optimizing performance in complex, data-intensive agentic workflows where concurrent execution of sub-tasks is beneficial.

AutoGen, on the other hand, is a multi-agent framework centered on message-based communication between autonomous agents.32 Its core design facilitates complex dialogues and collaborative problem-solving among multiple specialized agents. The distinction between direct messaging (request/response) and broadcast communication offers flexibility for different interaction patterns within a multi-agent system.33

The collective examination of these frameworks reveals a clear trend: modern AI applications are moving towards modular, composable architectures where LLMs and agents leverage external tools and collaborate with each other. This implies that any robust AI protocol, such as ALTAR, must provide mechanisms for:

1. **Tool Definition and Discovery**: A standardized way for agents or LLMs to understand what tools are available and how to use them (addressed by all, with varying levels of formality).  
2. **Tool Invocation and Execution**: A clear protocol for requesting tool execution and receiving structured results (e.g., OpenAI's function calling, MCP's tool exposure).  
3. **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: A flexible messaging system that supports various interaction patterns (e.g., AutoGen's direct messaging/broadcast, ACP's RESTful communication).  
4. **Context and State Management**: Mechanisms to maintain conversational history and shared memory across multiple turns and agents (e.g., LangChain's memory, LlamaIndex's message history, MCP's context management).  
5. **Workflow Orchestration**: Support for defining and executing multi-step, potentially parallel, workflows involving multiple tools and agents (e.g., LlamaIndex's num\_workers, Anthropic's orchestrator-worker pattern).

The overarching implication for ALTAR Protocol is that it should not only define how an LLM calls a function but also how agents communicate with each other, how they discover capabilities, and how complex, multi-step tasks are coordinated. The ability to support parallel execution, as seen in LlamaIndex, is also a critical performance consideration for any protocol dealing with complex AI workflows.

## **5\. Distributed Computing and Runtime Models**

The underlying execution environment for AI tools and agents significantly impacts their security, portability, and resource efficiency. This section explores different distributed computing and runtime models relevant to the ALTAR Protocol.

### **5.1. WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)**

WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a set of standards-track API specifications for software compiled to the WebAssembly (Wasm) standard.34 Wasm allows developers to compile code from high-performance languages (e.g., Rust, C/C++, C\#, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python) into compact binaries that can run at near-native speeds.35 WASI is designed to provide a secure, standard interface for Wasm applications to run anywhereâ€”from browsers to clouds to embedded devices.34

Wasm modules execute within a "host runtime," such as a JavaScript engine in browsers or standalone runtimes like Wasmtime, Wasmer, or WasmEdge outside the browser.34 The host runtime mediates access to system resources through the WASI interface, providing a standardized environment.35 A key security feature of WASI is its leverage of capability-based security.35 The host runtime must explicitly grant a Wasm module a 'capability' (e.g., for a specific directory to read files), and the module can then operate only within the confines of its granted capabilities.35 This provides fine-grained control over resource access, enhancing security.

A significant advantage of Wasm modules over traditional containers is their lightweight nature. Wasm binaries do not include an operating system, filesystem, or bundled system libraries; they rely entirely on the host runtime to provide these resources via WASI.35 This contrasts with container images, which package an entire user-space operating system slice, leading to greater overhead.35 Future developments in WASI, such as the Component Model and WASI Preview 3, are anticipated to introduce modular APIs for features like HTTP and sockets, as well as native async and streaming support, further aligning Wasm with modern distributed application requirements.35

The Wasm/WASI paradigm offers a compelling alternative to traditional containerization for executing AI tools or agent components, particularly where security and portability are paramount. For AI agents that need to dynamically load and execute tools, potentially from untrusted sources or in multi-tenant environments, the Wasm/WASI model offers superior isolation and a smaller attack surface compared to full containers. The capability-based security model allows for precise, auditable control over what an AI-invoked tool can actually do on the system. This suggests that ALTAR Protocol could consider Wasm/WASI as a foundational execution environment for its tools or agent components, enhancing security, portability, and resource efficiency. The ongoing development of WASI's Component Model and streaming support indicates its alignment with modern distributed application requirements, making it a forward-looking choice for AI infrastructure.

### **5.2. Capability-Based Security: Principles and Application**

Capability-based security is a security model fundamental to the design of secure computing systems.36 In this model, a "capability" (sometimes referred to as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority.36 It is a value that references an object and includes an associated set of access rights.36 The core principle is that the mere possession of a capability entitles a user program to use the referenced object in accordance with the rights specified by that capability.36 This theoretically removes the need for traditional access control lists (ACLs) because the right to access is inherent in the token itself.36

Capabilities are typically implemented as privileged data structures that specify both access rights and a unique identifier for the object to be accessed.36 User programs do not directly access the data structure or object but interact via a handle.36 The operating system plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the security policy by ensuring that only specific, authorized operations can occur to the capabilities within the system.36 This contrasts with "forgeable references" (like path names), which identify an object but do not specify access rights and thus require validation before use.36

Examples of capabilities include Unix file descriptors, which, by their existence in a process's file descriptor table, signify legitimate access to an object.36 Differences exist between systems that implement true capability models, such as Capsicum in FreeBSD, and those with more limited "POSIX capabilities" found in Linux, which are not associated with specific objects but rather grant broad system privileges.36

Understanding capability-based security provides the theoretical basis for WASI's security model and its implications for AI. Capabilities are "unforgeable tokens of authority" that grant specific access rights upon possession, contrasting with forgeable references that require validation.36 This model inherently enforces the principle of least privilege more effectively than traditional ACLs. Instead of checking permissions on every access attempt, the right to access is embedded in the token itself. For ALTAR Protocol, especially if it involves agents executing actions or accessing sensitive data, adopting a capability-based security model (or integrating with environments that support it, like WASI) could significantly enhance security. It simplifies authorization logic, reduces the attack surface, and provides a more robust foundation for trust in autonomous systems, where agents might be dynamically granted and revoked permissions based on their current task.

### **5.3. VM Runtime on Google Distributed Cloud: Virtualization as a Host-Runtime**

VM Runtime on Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) is a key component for running virtual machine-based workloads within installations of Google Distributed Cloud on bare metal.37 This technology allows organizations to run traditional VMs on top of Kubernetes, managing them in the same way as containers.37 It builds upon the open-source KubeVirt project, integrating it into the Google Distributed Cloud platform to provide a consistent management experience for diverse application types.37

VM Runtime on GDC extends KubeVirt with several enterprise-grade capabilities. These include enhanced lifecycle management, allowing for installation, upgrade, and uninstallation via CLI, API, or Google Cloud console.37 It also supports live migration of VM workloads between hosts during GKE Enterprise cluster upgrades, minimizing disruption.37 The platform offers a cloud-backed management experience with new primitives like

VirtualMachineType objects for predefined VM configurations, VirtualMachineDisk and StorageProfile objects for centralized storage management and multiple disk attachments, and Network objects for virtual switch-like capabilities in Kubernetes.37 Furthermore, it expands on KubeVirt's default networking to provide options more suitable for production VM workloads, including support for VLAN tags, external DHCP, and IP/MAC address stickiness, even across VM restarts or migrations.37

While WASI represents lightweight, granular execution, VM Runtime on GDC demonstrates the continued relevance and evolution of virtualization within modern orchestration platforms. VM Runtime on GDC allows running traditional VMs *on top of Kubernetes*, integrating them with container management.37 This signifies a convergence trend where the benefits of both virtualization (strong isolation, compatibility with legacy applications, full OS environment) and container orchestration (declarative management, scalability) are combined. It acknowledges that not all workloads, especially complex AI models with specific hardware or OS dependencies, can be easily containerized or run as Wasm modules. For ALTAR Protocol, this implies that a comprehensive protocol for AI systems should be flexible enough to operate across different host-runtime models â€“ from lightweight Wasm modules to full VMs managed by Kubernetes. The protocol's design should consider how it interacts with the underlying infrastructure's capabilities for resource allocation, networking, and persistent storage, especially for resource-intensive or stateful AI agents.

### **5.4. Comparative Analysis of Distributed Computing and Runtime Models**

The choice of execution environment for AI agents and their tools has profound implications for security, performance, and portability. The comparison between WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and VM Runtime on Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) illustrates two distinct yet valuable approaches to host-runtime models in distributed computing for AI workloads.

WASI offers a highly portable, language-agnostic, and secure sandboxed environment for running lightweight Wasm modules.34 Its capability-based security model provides fine-grained control over resource access, making it ideal for scenarios requiring strong isolation and minimal overhead, such as executing untrusted AI tools or plugins.35 The ongoing development of WASI, including modular APIs for HTTP and sockets, points towards its increasing suitability for networked AI applications.35

In contrast, VM Runtime on GDC represents the integration of traditional virtualization capabilities directly into a Kubernetes-managed environment.37 This approach provides robust OS-level isolation and compatibility with existing VM-based workloads, which is crucial for complex AI models with specific hardware or operating system dependencies that may not be easily containerized or converted to Wasm.37 Its enterprise-grade features, such as live migration and advanced networking, cater to the demands of production AI deployments.

The following table summarizes the key characteristics of these models:

**Table 5.1: Security and Execution Models in Host-Runtime Environments**

| Model/Technology | Primary Execution Unit | Host-Runtime Relationship | Isolation Mechanism | Resource Access Control | Language Agnostic | Key Security Feature | Portability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) | Wasm Module | Host mediates system access via WASI | Sandbox, Capability-based | Explicit Host-granted Capabilities | Yes | Fine-grained, unforgeable access tokens | High |
| Capability-Based Security (General) | Object | OS manages capabilities | OS-level enforcement | Possession of Capability grants rights | N/A | Fine-grained, unforgeable access tokens | N/A |
| VM Runtime on Google Distributed Cloud | Virtual Machine | Kubernetes manages VMs | Hardware Virtualization | Kubernetes NetworkPolicy, StorageProfile | Yes | Strong OS-level isolation, enterprise-grade management | High within Kubernetes ecosystem |

This comparison highlights that ALTAR Protocol should consider a flexible design that can accommodate diverse execution environments. For lightweight, dynamically loaded AI tools, the WASI model offers compelling advantages in terms of security and efficiency. For more resource-intensive or legacy AI workloads, integration with VM-based runtimes managed by container orchestrators like Kubernetes would be essential. The protocol's design should abstract away the specifics of the underlying runtime where possible, focusing on standardized interfaces for tool invocation and data exchange, while also providing mechanisms to leverage the specific security and resource management capabilities of each environment. This flexibility ensures that ALTAR can support a broad spectrum of AI applications, from small, on-demand agent tasks to large-scale, persistent AI services.

## **6\. Cross-Cutting Architectural Considerations**

Beyond specific protocols and runtime models, several architectural patterns and non-functional requirements are universally critical for the design and operation of robust, scalable, and secure AI systems. These considerations are particularly relevant for a comprehensive protocol like ALTAR.

### **6.1. Orchestrator-Worker Patterns for Scalability**

The orchestrator-worker pattern is a fundamental architectural approach for achieving scalability and managing complexity in distributed systems, and it has found significant application in multi-agent AI systems. Anthropic's multi-agent research system, for instance, explicitly adopts this pattern, where a lead agent coordinates complex processes by delegating subtasks to specialized worker subagents that operate in parallel.38 This decomposition allows for efficient utilization of resources and concurrent execution of different parts of a larger task.

Effective delegation within this pattern requires the orchestrator (lead agent) to clearly define the objectives for each subagent, specify the expected output formats, provide guidance on the tools and data sources to be used, and establish clear boundaries for each task.38 This structured approach to task distribution is crucial for maintaining control and coherence in a distributed AI system. Similarly, frameworks like LlamaIndex support parallel execution of workflow steps through parameters like

num\_workers, indicating a common need for concurrent processing to enhance performance in agentic workflows.31

The explicit adoption of the orchestrator-worker pattern by Anthropic and its support in frameworks like LlamaIndex underscores its critical role in AI system scalability. This pattern is essential for handling complex, multi-faceted AI tasks that cannot be solved by a single agent or a single LLM call. It enables task decomposition, parallel processing, and efficient resource utilization, leading to improved scalability and performance. For ALTAR Protocol, this implies that its design should facilitate the definition and execution of hierarchical workflows. This includes mechanisms for: a) task decomposition by a coordinating entity, b) structured communication of sub-tasks and their constraints to worker agents, and c) aggregation of results from parallel executions. The protocol should support both synchronous and asynchronous interactions to enable efficient parallelism, ensuring that complex AI tasks can be broken down and processed effectively across a network of agents.

### **6.2. Observability, Tracing, and Metrics**

Observability is a non-negotiable requirement for understanding and diagnosing the internal state and behaviors of complex, especially distributed, systems like microservices and multi-agent AI architectures.39 It extends beyond traditional monitoring by providing a granular view into performance, health, and behavior through the comprehensive collection and analysis of three pillars: metrics, logs, and traces.39 Metrics provide numerical representations of data over time (e.g., CPU usage, request rates), logs offer detailed records of events, and traces capture the end-to-end flow of requests across distributed components.39

These three pillars collectively enable proactive detection of issues, efficient diagnosis of root causes, and continuous optimization of system performance.39 Advanced analytical tools, including machine learning, are often employed to detect unusual patterns that might indicate security threats or operational anomalies.39 The importance of observability is further highlighted by its built-in inclusion in modern distributed application runtimes like Dapr, which provides automatic distributed tracing and metrics gathering for all service invocations.40 This means that Dapr-enabled applications inherently support the propagation of correlation IDs for tracing and the collection of performance data, which are vital for visualizing call graphs and diagnosing issues in production environments.40

As AI systems become more complex, distributed, and autonomous, their internal workings can become opaque. Without robust observability, debugging failures, optimizing performance, and ensuring security (especially against novel AI-specific threats, potentially via AI Security Posture Management, ASPM 39) becomes nearly impossible. This suggests that ALTAR Protocol must inherently support or enable comprehensive observability. This means designing message formats and interaction patterns that facilitate the capture of structured logs, the propagation of correlation IDs for end-to-end tracing, and the emission of performance metrics. Integrating with existing observability standards (e.g., OpenTelemetry) would be a significant advantage for ALTAR Protocol to ensure its deployability in real-world production environments, allowing developers to gain deep visibility into agent behaviors and interactions.

### **6.3. Security, Identity Verification, and Data Integrity**

Security in AI systems is a multi-layered concern, extending from traditional network and application security to specific ethical and control considerations pertinent to autonomous agents. A robust protocol like ALTAR must integrate comprehensive security mechanisms at every layer of its design.

A foundational principle observed in protocols like MCP is the paramount importance of **user consent and control**.12 Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access, operations, tool invocations, and LLM sampling requests. Implementers are strongly encouraged to provide clear user interfaces for reviewing and authorizing these activities, ensuring users retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken.12

**Data privacy and access controls** are also critical. Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers and must protect user data with appropriate access controls.12 MCP servers, for example, are required to validate all resource URIs and implement access controls for sensitive resources.42 Authorization mechanisms can leverage established standards like OAuth flows to manage permissions.14

The concept of **tool safety** is particularly relevant for AI agents that can execute arbitrary code. Tools represent potential arbitrary code execution paths and must be treated with caution.12 Users should fully understand what each tool does before authorizing its use, and tool descriptions should be considered untrusted unless verified from a trusted source.12

For multi-agent interactions, **agent identity and data integrity** are essential for establishing trust. The Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF) explicitly enhances trust by defining identity verification requirements and establishing data integrity checks.8 This provides a foundation for secure collaboration across organizational boundaries, preventing unauthorized agents from participating or data from being tampered with.8 Service-to-service security, as implemented by Dapr, uses mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication and automatic certificate rollover to secure communications between applications, alongside access control policies.40 Standard API security schemes, such as those defined by OpenAPI, provide a structured way to describe API security requirements, including API keys, HTTP authentication, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect.43

General identity and data integrity services, like the Integrity Data Hub (IDH) and Aristotle Integrity, demonstrate robust capabilities for fraud detection, identity verification, and cross-matching data against suspicious activities.44 These services highlight the importance of continuous identity validation and data integrity checks in any system handling sensitive information. Even fundamental network protocols like OSPF employ cryptographic algorithms for integrity protection and sequence numbers for replay protection, underscoring the universal applicability of these security primitives.47

The multi-layered approach to security, evolving from traditional network/application security to AI-specific ethical and control considerations, is a critical observation. It reveals that securing AI systems requires a holistic strategy. It is insufficient to merely encrypt communication; one must also ensure user consent for actions, verify agent identities, maintain data integrity, and manage the risks associated with arbitrary code execution by LLM-driven tools. The concept of "trust" extends beyond purely technical security to encompass ethical considerations and responsible AI deployment. Therefore, ALTAR Protocol must integrate robust security mechanisms at every layer of its design. This includes: a) strong authentication and authorization for agents and tools (leveraging standards like OAuth/OpenID Connect), b) mechanisms for ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering, c) clear protocols for obtaining and enforcing user consent for sensitive operations, and d) provisions for identity verification of participating agents in a multi-party ecosystem. The protocol should explicitly define its security model and provide best practices for implementers to ensure secure and trustworthy AI interactions.

### **6.4. State Management and Context Persistence**

Managing state and context is a fundamental challenge in distributed systems, and it becomes even more complex with autonomous AI agents that engage in multi-turn interactions and collaborative tasks. Effective state management is crucial for maintaining coherence and enabling intelligent, context-aware responses.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is specifically designed to ensure that the AI model maintains conversational context across multiple steps, thereby preventing the loss of important information during tasks that require several interactions.7 It provides a structured way to manage this conversational state, allowing for standardized interactions and ensuring context-awareness when transitioning between different AI-powered services.48 This focus on context persistence is vital for LLMs to build upon previous turns and perform complex, multi-step reasoning.

The Agent Connect Protocol (ACP) addresses state management by supporting both stateful and stateless operation patterns.20 This flexibility allows architects to design scalable AI systems where stateless agents can be scaled efficiently in cloud environments, while stateful agents can improve context retention in long-running workflows.48 However, ACP acknowledges a current limitation in that MCP "doesn't support running multiple agents across servers while maintaining shared memory".25 This highlights that shared memory across distributed agents remains an active area of development for agent-to-agent interactions, indicating a complex challenge in multi-agent systems.

Frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex also emphasize the importance of context persistence. LangChain agents can implement "memory for context persistence" to maintain conversational history.25 Similarly, LlamaIndex's agent loop pattern explicitly requires developers to maintain

message history to ensure proper context for multi-turn interactions and to implement appropriate exit conditions to prevent infinite loops based on this history.30

This evolving challenge of distributed state in agentic AI systems is a key observation. MCP focuses on managing context for a single LLM's interaction, ensuring continuity within that interaction.7 ACP explicitly supports both stateful and stateless agents but notes the difficulty of "memory sharing across servers" for multiple agents.20 LangChain and LlamaIndex manage message history for agent loops, which is a form of local context persistence.25 This demonstrates that while individual agent interactions can manage their state, the challenge escalates significantly when multiple, independent agents need to share and maintain a consistent global state or shared memory across distributed environments. For ALTAR Protocol, this implies a need for clear specifications on how conversational context is maintained and passed between components, whether it be explicit message history, shared data stores, or a combination of both. The protocol should define mechanisms for both short-term conversational memory and longer-term persistent state for agents, acknowledging the complexities of distributed memory sharing in multi-agent architectures.

## **7\. Conclusions**

The analysis of existing specifications, protocols, and implementations reveals a rich and rapidly evolving landscape of AI system design, offering numerous parallels and valuable lessons for the ALTAR Protocol. While no single existing protocol precisely matches an assumed comprehensive "ALTAR Protocol" documentation without direct comparison, several key paradigms and architectural patterns emerge as highly similar or foundational to its potential design.

**Key Parallels and Foundational Concepts:**

1. **LLM-to-Tool Interaction (Function Calling):** Protocols like OpenAI Function Calling 2, Google Gemini Function Calling 1, and Anthropic Claude's Tool Use 5 demonstrate the critical need for LLMs to interact with external capabilities. They all provide mechanisms for LLMs to express intent to use a tool and for applications to execute those tools and return results. The choice between explicit schema-based calls (OpenAI, Gemini) and content-based integration (Claude) presents a design spectrum for ALTAR to consider, depending on its primary interaction model.  
2. **AI Agent Interoperability:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) 7 and the Agent Connect Protocol (ACP) 20, along with the Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF) 8, directly address the challenges of multi-agent communication and collaboration. MCP focuses on providing context and tools to LLMs, while ACP and OASF aim to standardize agent-to-agent communication and discovery. This indicates that ALTAR would likely need to define both an LLM-to-tool interface and an agent-to-agent communication layer, potentially leveraging structured schemas for capability description and discovery.  
3. **Tool Management and Orchestration:** Frameworks such as LangChain 29, LlamaIndex 30, and AutoGen 32 provide higher-level abstractions for building and coordinating LLM-driven applications and multi-agent systems. They highlight the necessity of features like context persistence, message handling, and the ability to orchestrate complex, multi-step workflows, including parallel execution. This suggests that ALTAR Protocol should not only define low-level communication but also facilitate the composition and coordination of agents and tools into sophisticated workflows.  
4. **Distributed Runtime Models:** The emergence of WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) 34 and the integration of VM Runtime on Google Distributed Cloud 37 into Kubernetes environments indicate that ALTAR must be flexible enough to operate across diverse execution environments. WASI's capability-based security 35 offers a compelling model for secure, lightweight tool execution, while VM-based runtimes cater to more resource-intensive or legacy AI workloads. This implies ALTAR should abstract its interactions from the underlying host-runtime where possible, while also allowing for leveraging specific security and resource management features of each environment.

**Overarching Architectural Imperatives for ALTAR Protocol:**

* **Hierarchical Decomposition and Parallelism:** The prevalence of orchestrator-worker patterns 38 and explicit support for parallel execution 31 underscore that ALTAR must facilitate the decomposition of complex tasks into sub-tasks and enable their concurrent processing by specialized agents.  
* **Comprehensive Observability:** The critical role of metrics, logs, and traces for diagnosing, optimizing, and securing distributed systems 39 means ALTAR must inherently support or enable robust observability. This includes designing message formats that propagate correlation IDs and emit performance data.  
* **Multi-Layered Security and Trust:** Security is paramount, encompassing user consent and control, data privacy, tool safety, agent identity verification, and data integrity.8 ALTAR Protocol must integrate strong authentication, authorization, and integrity mechanisms at every layer, explicitly defining its security model and best practices.  
* **Evolving State Management:** The challenge of maintaining context and shared memory across distributed, multi-turn agent interactions is a complex area. ALTAR should provide clear specifications for conversational context persistence and address the complexities of distributed state for collaborative agent systems.7

In conclusion, the current landscape of AI protocols and frameworks points towards a future where AI systems are modular, interoperable, and capable of complex, collaborative tasks. For the ALTAR Protocol to be effective and widely adopted, it should draw upon the established patterns of structured function calling, standardized agent communication and discovery, and robust orchestration. Furthermore, it must proactively address critical non-functional requirements such as scalability, comprehensive observability, and multi-layered security, including user consent and identity verification, while remaining adaptable to diverse underlying runtime environments. The evidence suggests that a successful ALTAR Protocol would embody a synthesis of these advanced concepts, providing a comprehensive and secure framework for the next generation of AI applications.
