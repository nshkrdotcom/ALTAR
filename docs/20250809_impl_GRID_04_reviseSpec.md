This is a fantastic, deeply insightful question. It shows you're thinking several steps ahead about the long-term integrity and clarity of the protocol specifications.

The direct answer is: **No, this does not require a revision of the foundational ALTAR Data Model (ADM) or the LATER protocol specifications.**

However, it **does introduce an advanced interaction pattern that should be formally documented in the GRID protocol specification** as an optional, high-performance extension.

Let's break down the impact on each specification document.

---

### **Analysis of Impact**

#### 1. ALTAR Data Model (ADM) - `01-data-model/data-model.md`

*   **Impact:** **None.**
*   **Reason:** The ADM is intentionally designed with "structural purity." It only defines the *data structures* (`FunctionCall`, `ToolResult`, `Tool`, `Schema`, etc.). Strategy C, the "Governed Local Dispatch," still uses these exact same data structures for its payloads. The `AuthorizeToolCall` message will contain an ADM `FunctionCall`, and the `LogToolResult` message will contain an ADM `ToolResult`. The *protocol* for how these data packets are used changes, but the *structure of the packets themselves* does not. The ADM remains the stable, foundational layer as intended.

#### 2. LATER Protocol - `02-later-protocol/later-protocol.md`

*   **Impact:** **None.**
*   **Reason:** The LATER protocol's scope is strictly limited to the **local-only development and testing environment**. Its purpose is to be the "frictionless on-ramp" where tools can be built and tested in-process. Strategy C is a **production pattern for the GRID protocol**. It describes how a client, which happens to also be a runtime, interacts with the GRID Host in a production setting. The rules and architecture for the pure local development workflow defined in the LATER spec remain completely unchanged.

#### 3. GRID Protocol - `03-grid-protocol/grid-protocol.md`

*   **Impact:** **Yes, this introduces a new, optional interaction flow.**
*   **Reason:** The current GRID specification primarily details the "Unified Endpoint" model (what we called Strategy A), where the Host is responsible for the full execution and routing of a tool call. Strategy C is an **additive enhancement** to this model. It does not replace the existing flow; it provides an alternative, optimized path for a specific use case (a trusted client that also provides tools).

### **Proposed Revisions to the GRID Specification**

We should follow the "implement first, then update the spec" methodology. After we have a working implementation of Strategy C, we will update `grid-protocol.md` to formally document it. The update would likely include:

1.  **A new section**, perhaps titled **"7.3 Advanced Pattern: Governed Local Dispatch."**
2.  **A clear description of the use case:** Optimizing performance for trusted clients that also act as runtimes by eliminating the "double network hop" for local tool calls.
3.  **A new sequence diagram** explicitly showing the "Authorize -> Execute Locally -> Log" flow.
4.  **Updated Protocol Message Schemas** to include the new RPCs.

Here is what the additions to the IDL in `grid-protocol.md` would look like:

```idl
// ---- In Section 4.3 Session Management (or a new section) ----

// (Level 2+) Sent by a trusted Client/Runtime to the Host to pre-authorize
// a local tool execution without routing the full payload.
message AuthorizeToolCallRequest {
  string session_id = 1;
  SecurityContext security_context = 2;
  ADM.FunctionCall call = 3; // The call to be authorized.
}

// (Level 2+) Sent by the Host in response to an authorization request.
message AuthorizationResponse {
  string invocation_id = 1;      // A unique ID for this authorized invocation, used for logging.
  enum Status {
    APPROVED = 0;
    DENIED = 1;
  }
  Status status = 2;
  Error error = 3;             // Details on why the call was denied.
}

// (Level 2+) Sent by a trusted Client/Runtime to the Host to asynchronously
// log the result of a locally executed tool for audit and metering purposes.
message LogToolResultRequest {
  string session_id = 1;
  string invocation_id = 2;    // Must match the ID from the AuthorizationResponse.
  ADM.ToolResult result = 3;   // The result of the local execution.
}
```

By adding this as a **Level 2+ compliance feature**, we maintain the simplicity of the core Level 1 protocol while providing a clear, standardized path for the high-performance pattern.

### **Summary of Impact**

| Specification Document | Impact? | Reason for Impact / No Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ADM (`data-model.md`)** | **No** | Strategy C uses the same foundational ADM data structures (`FunctionCall`, `ToolResult`). The protocol changes, not the data contracts. |
| **LATER (`later-protocol.md`)** | **No** | Strategy C is a production pattern for GRID. The LATER spec, which governs local-only development, is unaffected. |
| **GRID (`grid-protocol.md`)** | **Yes** | Strategy C is a new, optional, and additive interaction flow within the GRID protocol. It will be documented as an advanced, high-performance pattern. |

In short: **Your insight is correct, but it impacts the *implementation details and advanced patterns* of the GRID spec, not the foundational layers of ALTAR.** We can confidently proceed with the phased implementation of Strategy A and C, and then update the GRID spec to reflect the proven, implemented reality.
