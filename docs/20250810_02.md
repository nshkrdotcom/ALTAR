### 1. The Verdict: What You've Built is Valuable

Let's be clear about what you have:

*   **A Solid ADM Core:** Your `Altar.ADM` modules are great. You have validating constructors for `FunctionDeclaration`, `FunctionCall`, and `ToolResult`. This is the foundation of everything.
*   **A Working LATER Runtime:** `Altar.LATER.Registry` (a `GenServer`-based registry) and `Altar.LATER.Executor` (a stateless execution module) are the correct, standard Elixir patterns for this problem. This is the heart of a local tool-use library.
*   **An Excellent `gemini_ex` Integration:** You've correctly isolated the serialization logic in `ToolSerialization` and have a powerful `ToolOrchestrator` to handle the multi-turn complexity. The `Gemini.Tools` module is a clean facade that bridges the two worlds.

#### Step 1: Kill the Layers and Simplify the Vision

The first and most important step is to simplify your mental model. **Forget about "LATER vs. GRID vs. AESP".**

*   **What you have is a `LocalToolRuntime`**. That's it. It's a library that allows you to define tools in Elixir and have them be executable from a standard data structure (`FunctionCall`). That is incredibly useful on its own.
*   Delete the `03-grid-protocol` directory from your conceptual model. GRID and AESP, as specified, are a complex, product-level distraction. They are not a protocol. If you need remote execution later, you'll solve it with standard Elixir distribution, gRPC, or Phoenix Channelsâ€”not by implementing that convoluted spec.

**Action:** Mentally (and perhaps literally) rename the `Altar.LATER` context to something like `Altar.LocalRuntime`. This clarifies its purpose.

#### Step 2: Evolve ADM's Schema into a Real Schema

This is the most critical technical change. The biggest weakness of the ADM spec is its crippled, hand-rolled type system (`parameters: map()`). Your code correctly implements this, but you can and should make it much better.

*   **The Problem:** Your `FunctionDeclaration` defines `parameters` as a raw map. This means your `Executor` can't perform deep validation (e.g., checking if a string matches a regex, if a number is within a range, or if a nested object has the right keys).
*   **The Solution:** Adopt a proper schema standard. **OpenAPI Schema / JSON Schema is the industry standard here.**
    *   Integrate an Elixir JSON Schema validation library like `ex_json_schema`.
    *   Change the `FunctionDeclaration` struct: `parameters` is no longer `map()`, but `%ExJsonSchema.Schema{}`.
    *   Update your `Executor` to use `ExJsonSchema.Validator.validate(schema, function_call.args)` before executing the tool.

**Action:**
1.  Add `ex_json_schema` (or a similar library) as a dependency.
2.  Update `Altar.ADM.FunctionDeclaration` to store a compiled schema object instead of a raw map.
3.  Update `Altar.LATER.Executor` to perform deep validation using the new schema. This replaces the weak validation you currently have with a much more powerful system.

#### Step 3: Reframe the "Promotion Path" as "Contract Consistency"

The "seamless promotion" idea is flawed because local and remote calls have different failure modes. Reframe this value proposition to be more honest and useful.

*   **The New Goal:** The contract (the `FunctionDeclaration` with its robust OpenAPI schema) remains identical whether the tool is executed locally or remotely. An LLM (or any other client) interacting with the tool doesn't need to know where it runs, because the interface is the same.
*   **The Reality:** Your *application code* will still need to handle the differences. A remote call can have network errors; a local call won't. This is fine and expected. Your clean separation allows you to build a `RemoteExecutor` in the future that has different error handling from your `LocalExecutor`, while both operate on the exact same `FunctionCall` and `FunctionDeclaration` structs.

**Action:** No code change here, just a change in mindset and documentation. Stop promising "no modifications." Start promising "a consistent, verifiable contract across all execution environments."

#### Step 4: Keep and Enhance the `gemini_ex` Integration

Your `gemini_ex` library and its integration are the crown jewels of this project. Keep them.

*   The `ToolSerialization` module is perfectly designed. When you upgrade ADM to use a real schema (Step 2), you will only need to update this module to correctly serialize your new schema objects into the JSON format that the Gemini API expects. This is a targeted, manageable change.
*   The `ToolOrchestrator` and the automatic tool execution loop are powerful features that correctly leverage the underlying ADM structures. They will continue to work, but will become more reliable thanks to the improved validation from Step 2.

### Summary: What to Do Next (A Concrete Checklist)

1.  **Simplify:** Get rid of the GRID/AESP baggage. Focus on perfecting your excellent local tool execution runtime and the `gemini_ex` client.
2.  **Strengthen the Core:** Replace the weak ADM `parameters` map with a proper JSON Schema implementation. This is your most important next step.
3.  **Update the Executor:** Enhance `Altar.LATER.Executor` to use the new schema validator for robust, deep validation of tool arguments.
4.  **Update the Serializer:** Update `Gemini.Types.ToolSerialization` to correctly serialize your new, richer schemas into the format required by the Gemini API.
5.  **Reframe your Vision:** Celebrate what you've built: a powerful, idiomatic Elixir library for local tool execution with a best-in-class Gemini integration. That is far more valuable than being compliant with a flawed protocol.
