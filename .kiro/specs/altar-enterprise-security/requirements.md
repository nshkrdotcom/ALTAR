# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ALTAR Enterprise Security Protocol (AESP) is a specialized, enterprise-grade orchestration protocol designed to enable secure, auditable, and observable interoperability between AI agents, autonomous systems, and enterprise tools within organizational boundaries. Building upon the foundational ALTAR protocol specification, AESP focuses specifically on the unique security, compliance, and governance requirements of enterprise environments.

The protocol addresses the critical enterprise need for a centralized, high-security orchestration system that provides comprehensive audit trails, role-based access control, multi-tenant isolation, and policy enforcement while maintaining the flexibility required for complex AI-driven workflows. Unlike universal protocols designed for open internet collaboration, AESP is purpose-built for controlled enterprise environments where security, compliance, and governance are paramount.
