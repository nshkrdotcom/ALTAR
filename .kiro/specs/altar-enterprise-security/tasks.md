# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the ALTAR Enterprise Security Protocol (AESP) design into a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks that build incrementally toward a complete, enterprise-grade security orchestration system. Each task is designed to be executable by a coding agent with clear objectives and specific requirements references.
