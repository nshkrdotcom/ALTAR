# GRID Specification Documentation Update Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to update the existing GRID Protocol specification documents in `priv/docs/specs/03-grid-protocol/` to incorporate the latest architectural insights, dual-mode operation, governed local dispatch patterns, and enhanced protocol messages identified in the GRID Protocol Revision analysis.

The updates will ensure the official specification documents reflect the current state of architectural thinking while maintaining backward compatibility and clear documentation structure.

4. WHEN documenting governed local dispatch THEN it SHALL include the complete authorize-execute-log flow with sequence diagrams
5. IF new compliance levels are added THEN they SHALL be clearly marked as Level 2+ features to maintain core protocol simplicity

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Protocol Message Schema Documentation

5. IF message extensions are added THEN they SHALL be clearly marked with their compliance level requirements

### Requirement 3: Advanced Interaction Patterns Documentation

**User Story:** As an enterprise architect, I want detailed documentation of advanced patterns like governed local dispatch and bidirectional tool calls, so that I can design high-performance, secure AI agent systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting governed local dispatch THEN it SHALL include performance benefits, security guarantees, and implementation guidance
2. WHEN describing advanced patterns THEN they SHALL include complete sequence diagrams showing all participants and message flows
3. WHEN documenting client library patterns THEN it SHALL specify both synchronous and asynchronous API approaches
4. WHEN adding cookbook patterns THEN they SHALL include concrete implementation examples and best practices
5. IF security implications exist THEN they SHALL be explicitly documented with mitigation strategies

### Requirement 4: Development Workflow and Testing Strategy Documentation

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want clear documentation of development workflows, testing strategies, and deployment patterns, so that my team can efficiently build and validate GRID-compliant systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting development workflows THEN it SHALL include both STRICT and DEVELOPMENT mode usage patterns
2. WHEN describing testing strategies THEN it SHALL specify unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches
3. WHEN documenting client libraries THEN it SHALL include decorator patterns, type introspection, and ADM schema generation
4. WHEN adding deployment guidance THEN it SHALL include co-location strategies and performance optimization techniques
5. IF multi-language development is discussed THEN it SHALL provide concrete examples for Python and Elixir implementations

### Requirement 5: Security Model Enhancement Documentation

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want updated documentation that clearly explains how new patterns maintain the Host-centric security model, so that I can validate enterprise compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting security enhancements THEN it SHALL explicitly state how governed local dispatch maintains Host authority
2. WHEN describing authorization caching THEN it SHALL include mandatory cache invalidation strategies and TTL requirements
3. WHEN documenting development mode THEN it SHALL include clear security warnings and production usage prohibitions
4. WHEN updating AESP integration points THEN it SHALL specify how new patterns integrate with enterprise security controls
5. IF new security risks are introduced THEN they SHALL be documented with specific mitigation requirements

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization Documentation

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want detailed documentation of performance optimization strategies and their trade-offs, so that I can design high-throughput AI agent systems without compromising security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting performance optimizations THEN it SHALL include latency measurements and throughput considerations
2. WHEN describing caching strategies THEN it SHALL specify cache invalidation mechanisms and consistency guarantees
3. WHEN documenting connection management THEN it SHALL include pooling strategies and resource optimization techniques
4. WHEN adding co-location guidance THEN it SHALL specify deployment patterns and network topology considerations
5. IF performance trade-offs exist THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with decision criteria

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility and Migration Documentation

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want clear documentation of backward compatibility guarantees and migration paths, so that I can upgrade existing GRID implementations without service disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting new features THEN they SHALL be clearly marked as additive and optional
2. WHEN specifying compliance levels THEN they SHALL maintain existing Level 1 compatibility requirements
3. WHEN adding migration guidance THEN it SHALL include step-by-step upgrade procedures
4. WHEN documenting version negotiation THEN it SHALL specify how clients and servers handle protocol evolution
5. IF breaking changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with workaround strategies

### Requirement 8: Implementation Examples and Code Samples

**User Story:** As a developer implementing GRID clients or runtimes, I want concrete code examples and implementation patterns, so that I can quickly build working systems following best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing code examples THEN they SHALL include both Python and Elixir implementations
2. WHEN documenting client libraries THEN they SHALL include decorator usage, type hints, and ADM schema generation examples
3. WHEN showing protocol flows THEN they SHALL include complete request/response examples with actual message payloads
