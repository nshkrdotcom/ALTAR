# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a complete ALTAR Data Model (ADM) v1.0 specification that serves as the foundational, language-agnostic contract for the entire ALTAR ecosystem. The ADM will provide the universal data structures for AI tools and their interactions, ensuring compatibility with established industry patterns while maintaining structural purity separate from execution and transport logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Universal Data Contract

**User Story:** As a protocol architect, I want a single, authoritative specification for AI tool data structures, so that all ALTAR ecosystem components can interoperate seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ADM specification is implemented THEN it SHALL serve as the single source of truth for tool structure definitions
2. WHEN different language implementations use the ADM THEN they SHALL be able to communicate without data format mismatches
3. WHEN the ADM is referenced by LATER and GRID protocols THEN it SHALL provide all necessary data structure definitions

### Requirement 2: Industry Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with LLM providers, I want the ADM to be compatible with existing function calling APIs, so that I can easily integrate with services like Google Gemini and OpenAI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ADM defines function calling structures THEN they SHALL be directly compatible with Google Gemini's function calling API
2. WHEN the ADM defines parameter schemas THEN they SHALL be based on OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
3. WHEN the ADM structures are used THEN they SHALL support seamless integration with existing LLM clients like `gemini_ex`

### Requirement 3: Structural Purity

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the ADM to define only data structures, so that execution and transport concerns remain separate and the specification stays focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ADM specification is written THEN it SHALL contain no references to execution logic, runtimes, or sessions
2. WHEN the ADM defines data structures THEN they SHALL be free of networking, transport, or host-specific fields
3. WHEN the ADM is used by other protocols THEN it SHALL not impose any execution or transport constraints

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Tool Definition

**User Story:** As a tool developer, I want complete data structures for defining AI tools, so that I can create tools that work across the entire ALTAR ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining a tool THEN the ADM SHALL provide a `Tool` structure containing function declarations
2. WHEN defining a function THEN the ADM SHALL provide a `FunctionDeclaration` structure with name, description, and parameters
3. WHEN defining parameters THEN the ADM SHALL provide a `Schema` structure supporting all necessary data types, including nested objects and arrays
4. WHEN defining data types THEN the ADM SHALL provide a `SchemaType` enumeration with STRING, NUMBER, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, ARRAY, and OBJECT types

### Requirement 5: Function Call and Response Handling

**User Story:** As an AI model integration developer, I want standardized structures for function calls and responses, so that I can handle tool invocations consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI model requests a tool invocation THEN the ADM SHALL provide a `FunctionCall` structure with name and args
2. WHEN a tool execution succeeds THEN the ADM SHALL provide a `FunctionResponse` structure containing a JSON-serializable object with a 'content' field
3. WHEN a tool execution fails THEN the ADM SHALL provide an `ErrorResponse` structure containing a structured error object with a 'message' field

### Requirement 6: Language-Neutral Definition

**User Story:** As a multi-language ecosystem maintainer, I want language-neutral data structure definitions, so that implementations in different programming languages remain consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ADM defines data structures THEN they SHALL be presented in a language-neutral, JSON-like format
2. WHEN the ADM provides examples THEN they SHALL use JSON format for clarity
3. WHEN the ADM specifies field types THEN they SHALL use universal type names that map to any programming language

### Requirement 7: Clear Documentation and Examples

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the ADM, I want comprehensive documentation with examples, so that I can correctly implement the specification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each data structure is defined THEN it SHALL include a table of fields with types and descriptions
2. WHEN complex structures are defined THEN they SHALL include JSON examples showing proper usage
3. WHEN the specification is written THEN it SHALL use formal, precise, and authoritative language appropriate for a protocol specification

### Requirement 8: Three-Layer Architecture Alignment

**User Story:** As an ALTAR ecosystem architect, I want the ADM to clearly define its role in the three-layer architecture, so that its relationship to LATER and GRID protocols is understood.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ADM introduction is written THEN it SHALL clearly state its role as the foundational data contract
2. WHEN the ADM describes its relationship to other protocols THEN it SHALL specify that LATER and GRID protocols import and implement these data structures
3. WHEN the ADM defines its scope THEN it SHALL explicitly exclude execution and transport concerns that belong to higher-layer protocols
