# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ALTAR v1.0 Finalization project aims to evolve the ALTAR protocol suite from a robust theoretical model into a production-ready blueprint. This involves integrating critical patterns and security features identified from comparative analysis, making implicit strengths explicit, formalizing key data structures, and providing clear implementation guidance for advanced real-world interaction patterns.

The finalization focuses on four core areas: adding unique invocation tracking to the ADM, formalizing the ToolManifest structure for Host-centric security, creating advanced interaction pattern documentation, and enhancing the main project documentation to highlight security features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Integrate Unique Invocation ID System

**User Story:** As a protocol implementer, I want unique invocation identifiers in function calls and results, so that I can implement end-to-end tracing, idempotency, and proper correlation between requests and responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a FunctionCall structure is defined THEN it SHALL include a call_id field as the first field
2. WHEN a ToolResult structure is defined THEN it SHALL include a call_id field as the first field that correlates to the originating FunctionCall
3. WHEN the call_id field is specified THEN it SHALL be of type String and marked as required
4. WHEN the call_id is described THEN it SHALL be documented as a unique, client-generated identifier for idempotency and correlation
5. WHEN JSON Schema representations are provided THEN they SHALL include the new call_id field
6. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate proper usage of the call_id field

### Requirement 2: Formalize ToolManifest Structure

**User Story:** As a GRID Host implementer, I want a formal ToolManifest data structure, so that I can implement the Host-centric security model with a concrete, serializable format for trusted tool contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ADM specification is updated THEN it SHALL include a new section 4.6 titled "ToolManifest Structure"
2. WHEN the ToolManifest structure is defined THEN it SHALL include manifest_version, contracts, and global_metadata fields
3. WHEN the manifest_version field is specified THEN it SHALL be a required String representing semantic version
4. WHEN the contracts field is specified THEN it SHALL be a required array of ToolContract objects
5. WHEN the global_metadata field is specified THEN it SHALL be an optional Map<String, String> for manifest-level metadata
6. WHEN the ToolManifest is documented THEN it SHALL include design rationale explaining its role in Host-centric security
7. WHEN the ToolManifest is specified THEN it SHALL include complete JSON Schema representation and practical examples

### Requirement 3: Create Advanced Interaction Patterns Documentation

**User Story:** As a protocol implementer, I want comprehensive documentation of advanced interaction patterns, so that I can implement complex real-world scenarios like bidirectional tool calls and stateful services using the protocol's primitives safely and effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GRID protocol specification is updated THEN it SHALL include a new section 7 titled "Advanced Interaction Patterns (Cookbook)"
2. WHEN bidirectional tool calls are documented THEN they SHALL include a subsection 7.1 explaining Runtime-as-Client pattern
3. WHEN the bidirectional pattern is explained THEN it SHALL include a Mermaid sequence diagram showing Host-mediated flow
4. WHEN the Host-mediated approach is described THEN it SHALL explain security and observability advantages over direct runtime-to-runtime calls
5. WHEN stateful services are documented THEN they SHALL include a subsection 7.2 explaining how to expose stateful logic as formal tools
6. WHEN stateful service patterns are provided THEN they SHALL include conceptual ADM FunctionDeclaration examples for get_variable and set_variable tools
7. WHEN the cookbook section is complete THEN it SHALL provide concrete patterns that solve complex problems using protocol primitives

### Requirement 4: Enhance Root Documentation Security Visibility

**User Story:** As a project evaluator, I want the security model prominently featured in the main README, so that I can immediately understand the core security value proposition when reviewing the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the README.md is updated THEN the GRID Protocol description SHALL explicitly highlight the Host-Centric Security Model
2. WHEN the security model is mentioned THEN it SHALL emphasize enterprise-grade safety and governance capabilities
3. WHEN the description is revised THEN it SHALL maintain the existing structure while elevating security visibility
4. WHEN the changes are made THEN they SHALL ensure the core security value proposition is immediately visible to readers

### Requirement 5: Maintain Specification Integrity and Consistency

**User Story:** As a protocol implementer, I want all specification updates to maintain consistency with existing documentation, so that I can rely on a coherent and professional specification suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any specification file is modified THEN it SHALL maintain consistency with the existing document structure and formatting
2. WHEN new sections are added THEN they SHALL follow the established numbering and heading conventions
3. WHEN JSON schemas are provided THEN they SHALL be complete and valid according to JSON Schema standards
4. WHEN examples are included THEN they SHALL be realistic, complete, and demonstrate best practices
5. WHEN cross-references are made THEN they SHALL accurately point to existing sections and maintain link integrity
6. WHEN technical terminology is used THEN it SHALL be consistent with definitions established in other specification documents
