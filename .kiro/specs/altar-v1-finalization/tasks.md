-

- [x] 2. Enhance ADM ToolResult structure with correlation ID




  - Add call_id field as the first field in ToolResult structure definition table
  - Update field to be String type, Required, with description emphasizing correlation to originating FunctionCall
  - Update JSON Schema representation to include call_id as required field
  - Update all ToolResult examples to include matching call_id values from corresponding FunctionCall examples
  - Ensure examples demonstrate both SUCCESS and ERROR cases with proper call_id correlation
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6_
-

- [x] 3. Create ToolManifest structure in ADM specification




  - Add new section 4.6 titled "ToolManifest Structure" after the ToolResult section
  - Create structure definition table with manifest_version (String, Required), contracts (ToolContract[], Required), and global_metadata (Map<String, String>, Optional) fields
  - Add Design Rationale subsection explaining ToolManifest role as concrete, serializable format for Host-centric security model
  - Include complete JSON Schema representation for ToolManifest structure
  - Provide realistic JSON example containing at least two different ToolContract objects demonstrating enterprise-grade tool management
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7_

- [x] 4. Update ADM introduction to include ToolManifest





  - Locate the ADM introduction section that lists core data structures
  - Add ToolManifest as a core exportable data structure alongside Tool, FunctionCall, and ToolResult
  - Ensure consistent presentation and description style with existing structure introductions
  - _Requirements: 2.6, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Create Advanced Interaction Patterns section in GRID specification




  - Add new major section 7 titled "Advanced Interaction Patterns (Cookbook)" at the end of GRID protocol document
  - Create introductory text explaining purpose of providing concrete implementation guidance for complex real-world scenarios
  - Ensure section follows established GRID specification formatting and numbering conventions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 5.1, 5.2_
-

- [x] 6. Document bidirectional tool calls pattern




  - Create subsection 7.1 titled "Bidirectional Tool Calls (Runtime-as-Client)"
  - Write explanation of Runtime-as-Client pattern for scenarios where tool execution requires calling another tool
  - Include the specified Mermaid sequence diagram showing Host-mediated flow between Client, Host, Python Runtime, and Elixir Runtime
  - Add explanatory text emphasizing security and observability advantages of Host-mediated approach over direct runtime-to-runtime calls
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
-

- [x] 7. Document stateful services as tools pattern




  - Create subsection 7.2 titled "Implementing Stateful Services as Tools"
  - Write explanation of how stateful logic should be exposed to ALTAR ecosystem as formal tools
  - Provide conceptual ADM FunctionDeclaration examples for get_variable and set_variable tools
  - Demonstrate how stateful services become securable, auditable runtimes that fulfill contracts
  - Ensure examples show realistic parameter schemas and descriptions without implementation details
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 3.6, 3.7_
-

- [x] 8. Enhance README security model visibility




  - Locate the GRID Protocol description in the main README.md Mermaid diagram section
  - Modify the GRID Protocol description to explicitly mention "Host-Centric Security Model"
  - Update text to emphasize "enterprise-grade safety and governance" capabilities
  - Maintain existing README structure and tone while elevating security value proposition visibility
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Validate specification consistency and quality




  - Review all modified files for consistent formatting, numbering, and cross-reference accuracy
  - Validate all JSON schemas for syntactic correctness and completeness
  - Ensure all examples are realistic, complete, and demonstrate best practices with complex scenarios
  - Verify technical terminology consistency across all modified specification documents
  - Confirm all cross-references point to existing sections and maintain link integrity
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6_
