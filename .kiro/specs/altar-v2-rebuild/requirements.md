# ALTAR v2.0 Rebuild: Requirements Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the requirements for rebuilding ALTAR from the ground up, incorporating critical lessons learned from the v1.0 implementation and addressing fundamental architectural flaws identified through expert critique.

## Executive Summary

The current ALTAR v1.0 suffers from:
- **Crushing complexity** with excessive layering (ADM → LATER → GRID → AESP with 7+ compliance levels)
- **Fundamental design flaws** including weak schema validation, optional security, and confusing protocol vs. product boundaries
- **Critical missing features** like deadline propagation, proper error handling, and standardized operation semantics

ALTAR v2.0 will be a **minimal, secure, and production-ready** tool execution protocol that learns from 40+ years of distributed systems history.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Minimal and Focused
- **Single Purpose**: Tool definition, validation, and execution
- **No Product Features**: Remove enterprise platform components (Cost Manager, Governance Manager, etc.)
- **Clear Boundaries**: Separate protocol specification from implementation patterns

### 2. Security by Design
- **Security First**: Security context is mandatory, not optional
- **Host-Centric Model**: Maintain centralized contract authority
- **Zero Trust**: Every operation requires explicit authorization

### 3. Standards-Based
- **Industry Standards**: Use OpenAPI Schema, not custom schema formats
- **Proven Patterns**: Adopt gRPC patterns for distributed systems
- **Interoperability**: Direct compatibility with existing AI ecosystems
