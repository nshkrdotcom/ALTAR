# GRID Protocol Revision Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to revise and enhance the GRID Protocol based on insights from recent implementation planning and architectural analysis. The revision incorporates lessons learned from multi-language development workflows, performance optimization patterns, and enterprise security requirements while maintaining the core Host-Runtime architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Development vs Production Mode Support

**User Story:** As a GRID Host operator, I want to configure the Host to operate in either STRICT (production) or DEVELOPMENT mode, so that I can enforce security in production while enabling rapid iteration in development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Host is configured in STRICT mode THEN it SHALL only accept tool contracts from a static, version-controlled ToolManifest.json file loaded at startup
2. WHEN the Host is configured in DEVELOPMENT mode THEN it SHALL accept dynamic tool registrations from Runtimes via RegisterTools messages
3. WHEN a Runtime connects in STRICT mode THEN it SHALL only be able to fulfill existing contracts, not define new ones
4. WHEN a Runtime connects in DEVELOPMENT mode THEN it SHALL be able to register new tool contracts for the duration of its session
5. IF the Host is in DEVELOPMENT mode THEN it MUST log warnings indicating the reduced security posture

### Requirement 2: Governed Local Dispatch Pattern

**User Story:** As a Python client application that also provides tools, I want to execute my local tools with zero network latency while maintaining full GRID Host governance, so that I can achieve high performance without bypassing security controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client has a local implementation of a tool THEN it SHALL first send an AuthorizeToolCall request to the GRID Host
2. WHEN the Host receives an AuthorizeToolCall request THEN it SHALL run the full security and policy pipeline (authentication, RBAC, Policy Engine) without routing the call
3. IF the Host approves the authorization THEN it SHALL return an AuthorizationResponse with status APPROVED and a unique invocation_id
4. WHEN a client receives an APPROVED authorization THEN it SHALL execute the tool locally via its LATER runtime
5. WHEN local execution completes THEN the client SHALL send a LogToolResult message to the Host for audit trail purposes
6. WHEN the Host receives a LogToolResult THEN it SHALL record the result in the immutable audit log for compliance and observability

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Protocol Message Schema

**User Story:** As a GRID protocol implementer, I want comprehensive message schemas that support both traditional routing and governed local dispatch patterns, so that I can build compliant implementations with clear contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the protocol THEN it SHALL include AuthorizeToolCallRequest and AuthorizationResponse messages for pre-authorization
2. WHEN defining the protocol THEN it SHALL include LogToolResultRequest message for asynchronous result logging
3. WHEN defining the protocol THEN it SHALL include RegisterToolsRequest and RegisterToolsResponse messages for development mode
4. WHEN defining message schemas THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with existing ADM data structures
5. IF new messages are added THEN they SHALL be marked as Level 2+ compliance features to maintain core protocol simplicity

### Requirement 4: Phased Implementation Strategy

**User Story:** As a development team, I want a clear implementation roadmap that delivers core functionality first while building in hooks for advanced patterns, so that we can ship incrementally while maintaining architectural integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Phase 1 THEN it SHALL deliver the Unified Endpoint model (Strategy A) as the default behavior
2. WHEN implementing Phase 1 THEN it SHALL design the Host and client libraries with Strategy C hooks from the start
3. WHEN implementing Phase 2 THEN it SHALL add the Governed Local Dispatch pattern as an optional, configurable feature
4. WHEN designing client libraries THEN they SHALL support configurable ExecutionMode (:remote as default, :local_first as advanced option)
5. IF implementing advanced patterns THEN they SHALL not compromise the security and governance principles of the core platform

### Requirement 5: Multi-Language Client Library Support

**User Story:** As a developer using Python or Elixir, I want canonical client libraries that handle the complexity of GRID communication patterns, so that I can focus on business logic rather than protocol implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing Python client library THEN it SHALL include AltarRuntime class for runtime server functionality
2. WHEN providing Python client library THEN it SHALL include AltarClient class for Host communication
3. WHEN providing Python client library THEN it SHALL include ADM data classes that mirror the ADM structures
4. WHEN providing Elixir client library THEN it SHALL include equivalent Altar.Runtime and Altar.Client modules
5. WHEN implementing client libraries THEN they SHALL handle gRPC boilerplate and provide decorator-based tool registration (@tool for Python)

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want a multi-tiered testing approach that validates both isolated components and full system integration, so that I can ensure the multi-language distributed system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing testing THEN it SHALL include unit tests for ADM structures, Host orchestration, and Runtime dispatching in isolation
2. WHEN implementing testing THEN it SHALL include integration tests that mock transport layers for rapid testing without network overhead
3. WHEN implementing testing THEN it SHALL include end-to-end tests with real Host and Runtime processes communicating over gRPC
4. WHEN creating examples THEN they SHALL serve as both documentation and proof of platform usability
5. IF tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear diagnostic information for debugging multi-language interactions

### Requirement 7: Transport Layer Abstraction

**User Story:** As a GRID Host implementer, I want a pluggable transport architecture that supports gRPC initially while allowing future transport mechanisms, so that the system can evolve without requiring core logic changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the Host THEN it SHALL implement a pluggable transport behavior pattern
2. WHEN implementing initial transport THEN it SHALL use Altar.GRID.Transport.GRPC as the primary implementation
3. WHEN adding new transports THEN they SHALL not require changes to core orchestration logic
4. WHEN designing transport abstraction THEN it SHALL support future protocols like WebSockets
5. IF transport fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Security Model Preservation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all GRID protocol enhancements to maintain the Host-centric security model and AESP compliance capabilities, so that enterprise security requirements are never compromised for performance gains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any execution pattern THEN the Host SHALL remain the single source of truth for tool contracts
2. WHEN implementing local dispatch THEN it SHALL require Host authorization before any execution
3. WHEN implementing development mode THEN it SHALL clearly indicate reduced security posture and never be used in production
4. WHEN logging tool results THEN they SHALL be recorded in the immutable audit trail for AESP compliance
5. IF security checks fail THEN the system SHALL deny execution and log the security violation

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization Without Security Compromise

**User Story:** As a high-performance application developer, I want to minimize network latency for local tool execution while ensuring all security and governance controls remain active, so that I can achieve optimal performance in a compliant manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing local tools via governed dispatch THEN the actual execution SHALL have zero network latency
2. WHEN authorizing local execution THEN the authorization request SHALL be lightweight and metadata-only
3. WHEN logging results THEN it SHALL be asynchronous to avoid blocking the client application
4. WHEN co-locating services THEN network latency between client and Host SHALL be minimized through deployment strategies
5. IF performance optimization conflicts with security THEN security SHALL take precedence

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility and Migration Path

**User Story:** As an existing GRID implementation maintainer, I want new protocol features to be additive and backward compatible, so that I can upgrade incrementally without breaking existing deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new protocol features THEN they SHALL be optional and additive to existing functionality
2. WHEN implementing new message types THEN they SHALL be marked with appropriate compliance levels
3. WHEN upgrading protocol versions THEN existing Level 1 implementations SHALL continue to function
4. WHEN migrating to new patterns THEN there SHALL be clear documentation and examples
5. IF breaking changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration guides
