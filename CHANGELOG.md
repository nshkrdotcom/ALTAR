### üéâ Added - First Implementation Release

This is the first official implementation release of the ALTAR protocol, providing a robust, production-ready foundation for local AI tool execution in Elixir.

#### üèõÔ∏è Architectural Foundation (`Altar.ADM`)
- **Validated Data Model:** Implemented the complete `Altar.ADM` (ALTAR Data Model) layer with type-safe structs (`FunctionDeclaration`, `FunctionCall`, `ToolResult`, `ToolConfig`).
- **Smart Constructors:** All data model structs are created via `new/1` constructors that perform comprehensive validation, ensuring no malformed data can exist at runtime.

#### üöÄ Local Execution Runtime (`Altar.LATER`)
- **Stateful Tool Registry:** Implemented `Altar.LATER.Registry` as a robust `GenServer` to manage the state of registered tool functions safely. It prevents duplicate registrations and validates function arity.
- **Stateless Tool Executor:** Implemented the `Altar.LATER.Executor`, a pure and stateless module that safely executes tool calls. It includes `try/rescue` blocks to gracefully handle exceptions within tool code, always returning a valid `ToolResult`.

#### üß¨ OTP Compliance
- **Top-Level Supervisor:** Added `Altar.Supervisor` to manage the lifecycle of the `Registry` process, providing a named, discoverable endpoint (`Altar.LATER.Registry`) for easy application integration.

#### üß™ Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Added a full suite of ExUnit tests, achieving 100% coverage for all modules in the `ADM` and `LATER` layers. Tests validate all success paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
